THE CALCULATOR

We are going to build a calculator for the portfolio project 

Team

*Fakhtaoui Ilyass*: 
 He is asked to coordinate the process for the portfolio project because he could arrange and make the steps for each one to do the work.

*Laachoubi Ayman* :
 He is asked to search for ideas for the portfolio project because he is a creative thinker and an ideas generator.

Technologies

In this project, we are going to work with HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT using Microsoft Visual Studio code before pushing it to a collaborative GitHub repository
We chose those languages because we have already encountered them

Challenges

The calculator helps users overcome the challenges of manual computation, enhances learning and understanding, and supports better decision-making through precise and quick calculations. While calculators are indispensable for performing calculations efficiently calculators still need to replace the need for human judgment, conceptual understanding, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence. Besides, the calculator is a versatile tool that will benefit diverse users, from students and educators to finance, engineering, and healthcare professionals. However, calculators can better meet the specific needs of users in different locales.

Risk

There is no risk.

Infrastructure

We are going to use Microsoft Visual Studio to write the code then each one of us is going to push their code to the Github repository of the portfolio project, in the end, we are going to merge our progress into one branch.

Existing solutions

There are a lot of products that already exist that do the same thing and process, we are just trying to implement some visual improvement and modification to the calculator.
